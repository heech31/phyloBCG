```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This folder contains R codes that produce the simulation and real data analysis results presented in the paper "Phylogenetically informed Bayesian truncated copula graphical models for microbial association networks" by Hee Cheol Chung, Irina Gaynanova and Yang Ni. [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05082.pdf)

## Simple example

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
